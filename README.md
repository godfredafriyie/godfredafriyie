# Python Projects

This folder contains 10 structured Python programs demonstrating control flow, input validation, loops, conditionals, and data analysis concepts. Each file is a standalone exercise completed as part of my technical coursework and showcases practical problem-solving with Python.

## Files and Descriptions
| File | Topic | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Q1.py** | Exam Results Analyzer | Counts pass/fail outcomes for 15 students using nested control structures and validation. |
| **Q2.py** | Integer Comparison | Compares two integers using relational and logical conditions. |
| **Q3.py** | Digit Separator | Accepts a five-digit input and prints each digit separately. |
| **Q4.py** | Piggy Bank Simulator | Adds user deposits until $500 goal is reached, validating input values. |
| **Q5.py** | Two Smallest Numbers | Finds smallest and second-smallest values among ten user inputs. |
| **Q6.py** | Change Calculator | Calculates correct change using minimal U.S. coin denominations. |
| **Q7.py** | Pattern Generator | Prints multiple star-based patterns using nested loops. |
| **Q8.py** | Mean, Median, Mode | Calculates key statistics from numeric data. |
| **Q9.py** | Outlier Impact | Shows how outliers affect mean, median, and mode. |
| **Q10.py** | Mode of Dog Breeds | Determines the most frequent breed in a given dataset. |

## How to Run
Each program can be executed independently:
```bash
python Q1.py
python Q2.py
...
python Q10.py
```

These scripts use only Python’s standard libraries (`statistics`, `numpy` for Q9) and are compatible with Python 3.8+.
